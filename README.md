# SEBM
Model from "Physics of Heat Waves"

The python script contains only the SEBM equations from the "Physics of Heat Waves" paper published in 2022. Text of the paper is available here: https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/35/7/JCLI-D-21-0236.1.xml.

The model takes solar radiation and precipitation as forcings - I used daily radiation from the AVHRR satellite and precipitation data from the CPC daily dataset. Please contact me if you need more information on the calculations that went into this paper.
